# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- The undocumented `LINGUISTIC_FEATURES_NO_ZEYREK_WARMUP` environment variable.
  The Zeyrek warm-up now always runs on import: skipping it and then analysing
  Turkish in the same process could crash on Windows.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- Initial public release.
